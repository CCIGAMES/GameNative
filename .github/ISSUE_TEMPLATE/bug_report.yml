        - Please be aware that some devices are not compatible. Snapdragon chipsets tend to be more compatible than most.
        (Examples: Exynos, Tensor, or other chipsets with a Mali GPU). 
        
        - Games with DRM are currently unsupported and the issue may be closed. 

        - If the bug was due to a hard crash, please attatch logs if possible.

        - If a game shows a soft error about `Failed to initialize graphics...` or anything inside the emulation environment, try editing the container settings.
          Note: Forums and subreddits will provide great help to configure certain games.
